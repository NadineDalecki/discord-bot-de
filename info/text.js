    Welcome1: "**Welcome to Echo Arena EU Teams!**\n\nThe place to make a team, play other teams and generally advance the EU Echo Arena scene with the ultimate goal of defeating NA teams in tournaments. This is a *closed-off private space from NA players*, so don’t mention this server or talk about its contents to NA players/official Echo discord. Keep discussions civil, don’t overly post memes or general pointless chatter. **Be respectful**, but as this is a competitive server some drama/salt/banter is expected between teams and players.\n\n**MIXED SCRIMS**\n\nMixed scrims are fun games with random players, kind of like public matches but with the same group playing each other in a private match. It’s a good way to play without waiting for new matchups and risk getting into matches with toxic players/unfair matchups/bad ping or other problems. A mixed scrim group will keep playing for as long as they feel like it (often 1-2 hours), with players dropping out and new players joining in, for example when someone drops out you can ask @Scrimmer for 1 more player in the discord. \n\n**Don’t join a mixed scrim unless you can play for at least 30 minutes, don’t ask for a mixed scrim unless you can play for about an hour.**\n\nOther than that, it’s first come first served. If you want to be alerted of these mixed scrims, join the @Scrimmer role by typing: `Affen scrimmer`\n\u200b\n",
  "Welcome2": "**TEAM SCRIMS**\n\nTeam scrims are “practice dates” where two existing teams can play each other over and over for practice or to try out strategies, usually for a duration of between 1 to 2 hours. If you are in a team you can tag the @Teams role and ask for a specific day or time, for example: @Teams scrims 7-9 SUK? This asks all teams if anyone wants to practice play sometime during 7 and 9 (UK time). That is, play for a duration of between 1-2 hours within that timeframe. If a timeframe fits your team and you want to play, answer and set it up in the chat. Avoid private messaging responses if possible.\n\n**Don’t ask for a team scrim unless you have made sure your team can actually accept it and play for at least an hour.**\n\nLooking for teams role: If you are looking for teams to join, assign yourself the @looking for team role by typing: `Affen looking for team`"
